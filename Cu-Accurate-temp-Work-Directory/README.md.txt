# Here is a code I developed during my graduate studies to simulate the 
# Extended X-ray Absorption fine structure (EXAFS).
# The main codes are located in the python notebook file: Accurate-temperature-project-Cu.ipynb
# All the files in the directory Dependent_files must by copied into the work directory before running 
# any branch of the code.

# Happy computing.
